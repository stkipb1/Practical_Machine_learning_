## Background  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, 
to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, 
but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, we use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. Given data from accelerometers, the goal is to predict the class of action 
which is one of the following:

* exactly according to the specification (A)
* throwing elbows to the front (B)
* lifting the dumbbell only halfway (C)
* lowering the dumbbell only halfway (D)
* throwing the hips to the front (E).
